spreadskos
==========

Convert linked data vocabularies created in a spreadsheet template to SKOS. This tool is meant to make it easier to create vocabularies for linked data on the web.

This is a Ruby gem and should be installed via 'gem install spreadskos'. Check out skos2html for a gem that converts SKOS to a human readable HTML file. Both are used in hhttp://siskos.herokuapp.com.

An example Excel template is available in the root directory. The template has two sheets. The first with some basic details about your vocabulary, and the second with the actual concepts.
